## Making Pelissier Car-Free


### The Idea

If you've ever been to the Downtown Windsor Farmer's Market, you've definitely been down Pelissier. The small one-way street hosts the market (and also the holiday market) every Saturday morning from spring to winter. The street is closed to all through traffic and only pedestrians are allowed. This allows for a very walkable environment in the downtown core, similar to Maiden Lane. When the market is not open though, the street is a two-lane one-way street with street parking on both sides. While the street is not usually busy, it can definitely be made more pedestrian-friendly.

So how can we make this a better environment for pedestrians and cyclists? Well, the title of this post gives a hint :). Removing the cars from Pelissier and making the entire street a pedestrian and bike space would make the street inherently safer. Without the cars, you can freely walk and bike along the entire portion of the street without fear of being struck by a vehicle. We already do this every Saturday morning for the Farmer's Market with great success, so why not expand the idea? What I'm proposing is closing Pelisser from Wyandotte (through traffic can still move east-west on Wyandotte) all the way to Chatham St West. In addition to that, adding [raised intersections](https://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/intersections/minor-intersections/raised-intersections/) at each cross street (Park St and University Ave) to force traffic that is moving along those streets to slow down into the intersection with a physical limitation (the raised intersection). This also reinforces to the driver that they are entering a *pedestrian area*, and must proceed with caution.

Additionally, the recent increase in residential construction downtown also means that more people will be out walking around, and providing residents with a safe way to walk around and explore the downtown, as well as do other errands like go to the grocery store ([there's a new one that just opened up on University and Pelissier](https://windsorite.ca/2021/07/la-verns-market-opens-in-downtown-windsor/)). This improves the quality of life for not only new residents to the core, but existing ones as well.

Here is a rough map of the proposal above to give you a better visualization of the idea:

### Who Else is Doing This?

We definitely would not be the first city to do something along these lines. For example, the City of Ottawa [converted Sparks St to a pedestrian promenade in 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparks_Street), one of the first pedestrian streets in Canada. The street has become a great success and is a [prominent tourist destination, as well as a local one too](https://www.sparkslive.com/). The City of Toronto recently [converted King St into a transit-priority corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Street_Transit_Priority_Corridor), which only allows public transit vehicles, pedestrians, and bikes. For detractors who may say "well that's a big-city thing. We couldn't something like that," I challenge that by presenting the City of London, Ontario also [recently completing the conversion of Dundas St to a "flex street"](https://london.ca/dundasplace), meaning no through traffic, although cars are still allowed onto the street, albeit the speed is limited to 30km/h. While still bigger than Windsor, London is definitely not the size of Toronto, yet they were able to make a similar transformation to the benefit of their downtown. This isn't a new idea that we would be taking on. This has been tested in many Canadian cities for decades to great success, and is something that we could do as well.

### How Would This Work In Practice?

You may have a lot of practical questions at this point: what about people who live on the street? How will they access their residence if they have a car? How about road maintenance? What about emergency services? How about businesses who are on the street? How will customers access them? How about delivery trucks for supply shipments? I will try to tackle this, but preface it by repeating the previous section: we are *not* the first city to do this, so we can learn from our peers to implement something like this. However, I will try my best to answer below:

- How will people who live on Pelissier access their building if they have a car?
  - This is a great question. The street is not completely closed off so residents can access their building, but there are barriers in the way to prevent through-traffic from speeding through. Firstly, planters or bollards can be installed to narrow the road to discourage speeding, as well as remove any sort of straightaways. Additionally, to enter the area the car would have to enter via the raised crosswalk, signalling they are no longer on the road, but in a pedestrian zone. Basically, people who live there can access the building, but they would have to drive very slowly on the street to enter and exit the area.
- How will customers to businesses on the street be able to access them? What about delivery trucks?
  - Another good question. Currently, there is quite a bit of street parking on University Ave which sits very underutilized. This could be used to make up for the missing parking along the Pelissier. There is also a parking deck along the street which can be used as well, and can be accessed by the means mentioned in the previous bullet. However, the main point here is that people who live nearby can walk to these places. There has been a recent increase in the number of residential construction projects in the downtown core, which means that there are more potential customers for these businesses. This is one of the benefits of mixed-use areas. For delivery trucks, most are smaller box trucks which can enter and exit via original bullet above (i.e. slowly)
- How would road maintenance like snow removal work? How about emergency services?
  - While I can't speak for the City of Windsor public works or emergency services, I again want to stress the fact that other cities are already doing this and we can easily see how these types of things are accomplished. However, my thought around this for something like snow removal is that in the winter, smaller snow removal vehicles are used to clear the areas (the City of Ottawa [already does this](https://i.cbc.ca/1.5426028.1579010098!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/sparks-street-ottawa-plow-snow-slush-traffic-pedestrian-winter-weather.jpg)). As for emergency services, the street is not closed off so they can access it. If pedestrians are present when they arrive, they can simply move out of the way as they would if they were in a car.

Raised intersections are also something new for the city, but again, these are not something that are a new concept. The intersections at University Ave,  Park St, and Chatham St W would remain the same, albeit they would now be raised up and would have a slope leading up into the intersection and down as you leave the intersection. They act to signify that cars are entering a pedestrian area, but also in a more practical sense, they act as a speed bump as well to force the driver to slow down when approaching this area. The current configurations of the intersections would also remain, although Chatham St W would now have a stop sign to allow pedestrians to cross. There are many other small things that could be configured such as planters, bike racks or lockers, but the key component is that pedestrians have the right-of-way and vehicles are guests in the space.

### Conclusion

If you've made it this far, great! Thanks for taking the time to give this proposal some thought. You must also have a passion for improving our city. While the above proposal may be bold for Windsor, it is by no means a bold one anywhere else. Paris is planning on [banning all through-traffic through it's core by 2022](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57109733). I don't think we're at that level yet, but I definitely feel that something like this is a great start to making our downtown a more walkable and vibrant neighbourhood.
