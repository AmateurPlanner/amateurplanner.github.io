## Making Pelissier Car-Free


### The Idea

If you've ever been to the Downtown Windsor Farmer's Market, you've definitely been down Pelissier. The small one-way street hosts the market (and also the holiday market) every Saturday morning from spring to winter. The street is closed to all through traffic and only pedestrians are allowed. This allows for a very walkable environment in the downtown core, similar to Maiden Lane. When the market is not open though, the street is a two-lane one-way street with street parking on both sides. While the street is not usually busy, it's still not a pleasant environment to walk in (albeit better than other streets in the city).

So how can we make this a better environment for pedestrians and cyclists? Well, the title of this post gives a hint :). Removing the cars from Pelissier and making the entire street a pedestrian and bike space would make the street inherently safer. Without the cars, you can freely walk and bike along the entire portion of the street without fear of being struck by a vehicle. We already do this every Saturday morning for the Farmer's Market with great success, so why not expand the idea? What I'm proposing is closing Pelisser from Wyandotte (through traffic can still move east-west on Wyandotte) all the way to Chatham St West. In addition to that, adding [raised intersections](https://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/intersections/minor-intersections/raised-intersections/) at each cross street (Park St and University Ave) to force traffic that is moving along those streets to slow down into the intersection with a physical limitation (the raised intersection). This also reinforces to the driver that they are entering a *pedestrian area*, and must proceed with caution.

Here is a rough map of the proposal above to give you a better visualization of the idea:

### How Would This Work In Practice?
