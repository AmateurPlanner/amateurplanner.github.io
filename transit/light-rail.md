# The Case for Light Rail

Rough notes:

Two Phases:
- phase 1 - Sandwich Town (Sandwich St to Prince to College loop) to UWindsor to the Via Rail Station
  - Use University Ave to Ouellette, then Ouellette to Wyandotte, then Wyandotte to Via Rail
- phase 2 - Via Rail to Tecumseh Mall (using Wyandotte to Lauzon)

- this route leverages the current density within the area
  - this is also apparent from the Transit Windsor master plan and existing crosstown 2, which highlight the need for crosstown system along this corridor
- follows a similar route to the original streetcar line
- serves major educational and employment institutions along the line

Aside:
Currently using iPad to draw the transit maps to use in the blog post. Could potentially use Gimp on the desktop or on the Mac as well (would need to find out how to do that)
