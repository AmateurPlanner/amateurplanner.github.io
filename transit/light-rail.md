# The Case for Light Rail

## A Brief History of Streetcars in Windsor

Before we begin, we first need to take a brief look into Windsor's transit history as it will lay a foundation for our case. Some readers may not know this, but Windsor was actually the [first city in Canada to have a fully electrified streetcar network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor,_Ontario_Streetcar_System) (opened in 1886), a full 3 years before Toronto electrified it's own network into what we now know as the TTC. The network stretched from Amherstburg all the way to Tecumseh. Essentially, at one point in time all the major neighbourhoods of the city, as well as some of the farther towns, could be reached without having to use a car. It wasn't until the late 30's/early 40's when the streetcar network was dismantled for buses. If you want to see some physical artifacts of the system, take a look at University Ave between the University of Windsor and Downtown. The street is very wide, and the reason being is that it was actually one of the main streetcar lines! The reason I feel that knowing this history is so important is that it shows us that we had this before, and we certainly can have it again.

## The Plan

### Overview

As you'll see, this proposed plan is very similar to the original streetcar system. The reasoning behind this is that the city grew around the original streetcar system, so much of the city's layout and density can be attributed to this (at least for the older neighbourhoods). By leveraging this existing foundation, we can know that we are serving the greatest number of people and don't have to make too many adjustments or risk any sort of eminent domain issues (which can be a sensitive topic) by removing any existing homes. You'll may also notice that I'm referring to the streetcar system but calling this post light rail. In my experience, each name can bring different imagery to different people. For the purpose of this, I'll be using light rail as a catch-all for any sort of non-subway rail. Basically, the plan borrows from the Waterloo light rail system ION, which has both on-street tracks as well as standalone rail track. This is a good candidate as the Waterloo region has a roughly similar population to the Windsor region, so a combination of streetcar-style (for within the city) and rail-style (for between cities, think interurbans) would be what is needed in the Windsor region.

To try and be realistic, the plan is separated into four phases, the first two phases focusing on Windsor proper and the second two phases focusing on the region as a whole. Below is a high-level overview of the proposed fully-completed system:

TODO: add image of full proposal here

### Phase 1: Sandwich to Walkerville

### Phase 2: Walkerville to Tecumseh Mall

### Phase 3: Downtown to Leamington (including St. Clair, Essex, and Kingsville)

### Phase 4: Sandwich to Amherstburg (including LaSalle)

Rough notes:

Two Phases:
- phase 1 - Sandwich Town (Sandwich St to Prince to College loop) to UWindsor to the Via Rail Station
  - Use University Ave to Ouellette, then Ouellette to Wyandotte, then Wyandotte to Via Rail
- phase 2 - Via Rail to Tecumseh Mall (using Wyandotte to Lauzon)
Below should be recognized for a truly regional system
- phase 3 - Downtown to Essex to Leamington (potentially along Ouellette to Dougall?)
- phase 4 - Sandwich to LaSalle to Amherstburg (using Front Road)


- this route leverages the current density within the area
  - this is also apparent from the Transit Windsor master plan and existing crosstown 2, which highlight the need for crosstown system along this corridor
- follows a similar route to the original streetcar line
- serves major educational and employment institutions along the line

- address different approaches: BRT, increased transit service/infrastructure, etc.

Aside:
Currently using iPad to draw the transit maps to use in the blog post. Could potentially use Gimp on the desktop or on the Mac as well (would need to find out how to do that)
